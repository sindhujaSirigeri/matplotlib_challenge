## Analysis
The current analysis looks into the relationship between mouse weight and average tumour volumn for the drugs, especially Capomulin regimen. The several plots including the linear regression finds a positive correlation between weight and tumour volumn under the campulin drug. They also exhibit that heavier mice tend to have larger tumor volumes.
